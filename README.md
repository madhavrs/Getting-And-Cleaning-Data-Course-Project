# Getting-And-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository contains files related to "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project. 

# Introduction
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at UCI Machine Learning Repository where the data was obtained.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.  

# What are the files in this repository? 
Apart from README.md file, there are two other files: 

#run_analysis.R
This file contains all the necessary code to merge the different datasets, clean them and prepare a tidy dataset.  

1.  Merge the training and the test sets 
2.  Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
3.  Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6.  Write the tidy dataset to a file named tidy_dataset.txt.

#CodeBook.md
This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data.
